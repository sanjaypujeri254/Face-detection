# Face-detection
This project demonstrates real-time face detection and recognition using Firebase Realtime Database along with OpenCV, CMake, Dlib, and face recognition libraries. The system captures live video feed, detects faces in real-time, recognizes them if trained, and stores/retrieves data using Firebase Realtime Database.



Requirements :
1. OpenCV
2. CMake
3. Dlib
4. Firebase Realtime Database
5. Firebase SDK for C++ (if using C++ for Firebase integration)
